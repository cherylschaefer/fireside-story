    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>Dark, because the sun had ceased to work. Night because it was also technically after 8pm.</p>
    <p>It was exactly 8:01pm when our hero arrived at the bank, but alas it was too late.</p>
    <p>Too late because the bank had closed.</p>
    <p>She ran back to her car to go to the store instead with her debit card.</p>
