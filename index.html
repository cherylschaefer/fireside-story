    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>Dark, because the sun had ceased to work. Night because it was also technically after 8pm. </p>
    <p>It was exactly 8:01pm when our hero arrived at the bank, but alas it was too late.</p>
    <p>To late because the bank had closed. And also too late because the world's financial systems had collapsed owing to the previously mentioned failure of the sun.</p>
